# DataStructures
List Implementation
This Classes  are designed for testing and learning purposes for beginners. 

Code is written as simple and readable as possible, To much thing's are missing if we compare it to  actual implementation from util package. few things have to be deleted. 

things  you will meet at List Implementation From scratch. 

 * LinkedList (Single, Double, Circular)
 * ArrayList 
 * Vector
 * Stack (With Vecor implementation, From scratch Array based, From scratch Node based) 

I bealive that they work as intended, If you find any bug or error, comment below and i'll update the class. 

Again Classes are for learning purposes, you can clone the repo and run it in your machine, List interface wount be added to repo, just delete interface implementation and remove annotation's from methods.
